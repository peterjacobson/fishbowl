            <h1>Reflect on feelings, needs and strategies</h1>
            <p>
              One way of thinking about communication (including non-verbal) is
              that it is all an attempt or a strategy to fulfil a universal
              human need. Sometimes these actions, words and behaviours might
              not be effective, they might even be defensive or violent. But if
              we understand the concept of needs, we may be able to empathise
              effectively with the person and find a way to work with them that
              is win-win.
            </p>

              Name it to tame it - naming feelings is a proven way to help
              someone come back to their senses from a freeze/fight/flight
              response.

            So it‚Äôs up to you whether you include them - just remember that if
            you do, some people may not want to share or speak to what‚Äôs real
            for them, and that‚Äôs okay too.

            <h3>Peach (uncomfortable) feelings</h3>
          </HelpText>
          <HelpText>
            Sometimes it can be hard for people to talk about and name
            uncomfortable feelings, which is totally understandable given the
            world many of us were raised in.
          </HelpText>
          <HelpText>
            <b>The value in including uncomfortable feelings</b> in a check-in,
            is it can help people to get really clear on what they need and take
            action, which may or may not include asking the group for support of
            some kind.

            Also, there‚Äôs an expression that goes ‚Äúname it to tame it‚Äù. In other
            words, sometimes just naming feelings is all we need to dissolve
            them. Like acknowledging ‚ÄúI felt angry‚Äù and then realising you‚Äôre
            need was just to acknowledge it.

            a need. Needs are not attached to any one time, place or person. For
